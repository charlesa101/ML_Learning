Data wrangling (synonymous with data cleaning) is used to transform structured or semi-structure datasets from one form into another.

    harmonizing date values so they all have the same format
    cleaning up inconsistent use of keywords, tags, or other enumerated data types.
    replacing missing values or incorrect with NULL (or whatever you want)
    transposing data so rows become columns, columns become rows
    merging columns together in some useful way
    filtering out unwanted values; removing columns.
    collapsing or truncating overly complex data into a more compact form
