Question 1
Level 1

Question:
Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5,
between 2000 and 3200 (both included).
The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

Hints: 
Consider use range(#begin, #end) method

Solution:
l=[]

for i in range(2000,3201):
    if (i%7==0) and (i%5!=0):
        l.append(str(i))
        
print(','.join(l))

Question 2
Level 1

Question:
Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers.
The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
8
Then, the output should be:
40320

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

Solution:
def fact(x):
    if (x==0):
      return 1
    return x * fact(x-1)

x= input()
print(fact(x))
