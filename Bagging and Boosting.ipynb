    "#Bagging - It is ensemble method where we use multiples models of same algoriths for diff subset of dataset randomdly.\n",
    "#And take the votes to the output.\n",
    "#Bagging is an ensemble technique mainly used to reduce the variance of our predictions by combining the results of multiple \n",
    "#classifiers modelled on different sub-samples of the same dataset. In Bagging, individual learner are trained in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Bossting - In this case, we give more emphasis on selecting datasets which gives wrong predicton in order to imporve accuracy.\n",
    "#Boosting builds on weak learners, and in an iterative fashion. In each iteration, a new learner is added, while all existing \n",
    "#learners are kept unchanged. All learners are weighted based on their performance (e.g., accuracy), and after a weak learner\n",
    "#is added, the data are re-weighted: examples that are misclassified gain more weights, while examples that are correctly\n",
    "#classified lose weights. Thus, future weak learners focus more on examples that previous weak learners misclassified.\n",

    "#Boosting is a method of converting a set of weak learners into a strong learner. \n",
    "#Many algorithms works with the concept of boosting but today, we will talk about three major boosting algorithms and will \n",
    "#look into their differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "#All these boosting methods differ on how they create the weak learners during the iterative process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#GBM generates learners during the learning process and  build first learner to predict labels and calculate the loss and it will build a second learner to predict the loss after the first step and so on. It minimizes the loss function (difference of actual and predictions).\n",
    "\n",
    "#Adaboost requires a set of weak learners before real learning process and assign the weights to these learners to be a strong learner. The weight of each learner is learned by whether it predicts a sample correctly or not. If a learner is mispredict a sample, the weight of the learner is reduced a bit. It will repeat such process until converge and accuracy increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#XGBoost is an advanced implementation of GBM having high predictive power (including a variety of regularisation (choose or define), reducing overfitting and improves overall performance) and is many times faster (parallel processing) and also works best in bias-variance tradeoff situations.\n",
